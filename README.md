# 💕 Forgive Me - Interactive Apology Website

A heartfelt, personalized interactive website created to apologize to someone special.

## ✨ Features

- **Beautiful Soft Pastel Design**: Using pink, lavender, and peach colors for a warm, gentle feel

     - The chopsticks date that never happened
     - Sleeping Beauty nickname and her love for sleep/skincare
